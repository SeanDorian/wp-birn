== Description ==

Join in on the [conversation](http://austinpassy.com/wordpress-plugins/custom-login) on my personal blog. I've also just released a [PRO](http://thefrosty.com/custom-login-pro) version on [http://thefrosty.com](http://thefrosty.com). New features include faster login loading (no database access), Custom Post Types (for multiple designs) and four default CSS designs.

Activate this plugin and customize your WordPress login screen. Use the built-in and easy to use settings page to do the work for you. Theres no need to understand CSS at all!
Now featureing a HTML &amp; CSS box for advanced users to up the customization!

1. Works great for client site installs.
2. Comes with a Photoshop template included in the library files (default theme).
3. Read more about the [Custom Login Plugin](http://austinpassy.com/wordpress-plugins/custom-login/) & [most recent blog post](http://austinpassy.com/2010/09/custom-login-version-0-8/).
